# README

- when I workout, I normally keep my plan and progress in a personal discord server or a simple text file.
- but that makes the logs hard to read/track
- I also use a metronome from google by literally googling "metronome" and using the google provided metronome
- I also don't really keep track of the rest times
- so to solve all of that, I made this
- it's a simple desktop app that keep track of my workouts, workout logs, rest times and metronome
